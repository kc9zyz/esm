            <h2>What does PV stand for?</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>PV stands for Photovoltaic</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Etymology</li>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Photo is derived from <i>phos</i>, the Greek word for light</li>
                     <li>Voltaic is derived from volt, the English word for electrical potential</li>
                  </ul>

            <h2>Renewable Energy Options</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Hydroelectric – harness flowing water to turn a turbine, which then causes a generator to produce electricity. This is done on a large scale with dams, however it can be implemented on a smaller scale as well.</li>
          
               <li>Wind – above ground turbines are spun by the wind to provide a generator with the mechanical work necessary to generate electricity. Wind farms are increasingly common both on land and offshore, where wind speeds are significantly larger.</li>
              
               <li>Solar – Photovoltaic (PV) cells capture sunlight and convert it into usable electricity. These systems can be installed on a small residential scale, on an industrial scale, or anywhere in between.</li>
         </section>

            <h2>Why Use Solar For My Home/Business?</h2>
            <ul>
               <li>Flowing water necessary for hydroelectric is not readily available for a majority of homes and businesses so individual hydroelectric power is impractical. </li>
          
               <li>Wind power requires a large footprint to erect wind turbines which is impractical for the average homeowner or business. Additionally, turbines are loud and unpleasant to have in a residential or commercial setting</li>
              
               <li>Solar panels or shingles can be installed on top of the existing structure provided it receives sufficient sunlight, eliminating the need for an additional footprint.</li>
         </section>

            <h2>How Does Solar Energy Work? </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>There are two types of solar energy systems: <Strong>ON GRID</Strong>, and <Strong>OFF GRID</Strong>.</li>
              
			  <li><Strong>ON GRID</Strong> systems have a connection to the local power grid, and allow for electricity produced by the solar sources to be supplemented with power from the grid, if the output is too low, or the electricity can be sold back if there is excess production.</li>
              
			  <li><Strong>OFF GRID</Strong> systems have no connection to the local grid, instead they have deep-cycle battery banks which are used to store electricity for use when the solar sources are not producing enough electricity. The stored electricity comes from times when there is an excess production of electricity.</li>
         </section>

            <h2>How Does Solar Energy Work? – On Grid </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Solar cells in PV panels or shingles collect sunlight and convert it to direct current (DC) electricity.</li>
              
			  <li>The DC electricity travels through an inverter, converting it into alternating current (AC) electricity (AC is what comes out of the outlets in your home).</li>
              
			  <li>From the inverter, the electricity is either sent into the powered building for use, or sold back if it is not needed.</li>
              
              <li>If the electricity is sold back, it travels through a meter to measure how much electricity has been sold back to the utility company so that the proper balance is paid by the utility company to the property owner.</li>
         </section>
		 
		 <section class="slide">
            <h2>How Does Solar Energy Work? – Off Grid </h2>
            <ul>
              <li>Just like on grid systems, solar cells collect sunlight and convert it into DC electricity.</li>
              
			  <li>The electricity is sent to a charge controller, which manages the charging and discharging rate of the batteries, so that they are never over-taxed or over-charged. </li>
              
			  <li>From the batteries, the electricity needed to power the building is drawn into the inverter, to once again convert from DC to AC electricity.</li>
              
              <li>The AC electricity is then supplied to the building for use.</li>

            <h2>How are Power Systems Mounted?</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>There are three methods to mount a solar panel system, while shingles can only be used as shingles:</li>
				<ul>
				<li><Strong>Two-axis tracking</Strong> - allows the system to follow the sun on its’ east-west journey each day. It also allows for the north-south tilt angle, which will gradually change with the seasons, to be adjusted periodically.</li>
			    
				<li><Strong>One-axis tracking</Strong> - allows the system to only follow one of the two paths of a two-axis tracking system.</li>
				
				<li><Strong>Fixed</Strong> - the system is completely restrained and has no motion. Residential and light commercial roof installations are typically fixed.</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>

		      <h2>What to do with Excess Power?</h2>
			  <ul>

		      <h2>What to do with Excess Power?</h2>

			  <li>Battery banks can be used to store electricity for later use. </li>
			  
			  <li>Be sure to properly size your battery bank for your needs.</li>
			  
			  <li>Include a charge controller to prevent overcharging the batteries, this will assist in extending battery life.</li>
